<div> <p class = "about" > “Elon Musk, a now 48 years old man with citizenship in the us, Canada and south Africa, is mostly known for being the founder of the two massively successful companies Tesla and SpaceX. Things that many know and love him for is how honest, creative and interesting he is. An example of his honesty is, were in an interview by wall street journal where he refused to answer questions about stock in tesla since he found the questions “boring” and an example of creativity is when managed to sell 20000 flamethrowers just to be able to send a tesla up in space, that is one of the most genius ideas I have heard of.
But what most people doesn’t know is how he got to where is now because he must have started somewhere, you don’t just come out of nowhere as a multimillionaire.</p>

<p class = "about"> Elon was born in 1971 with a father as an engineer and a mother as a nutritionist which shows that he wasn’t he didn’t get spoiled with a head start in the entrepreneur business. But although he had two working parents, he didn’t exactly have a “good” childhood, as Elon in his book called “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future” stated that he saw his childhood as being misery because of his abusive father.

<p class = "about"> But for his hobbies during his childhood, he was really Interested in videogames and tech which lead to him coding a game that he would sell to a company for his first major profit.
When he was 24 years old he started his first company, zip2, which he later sold and earned 22 millions in cash when he was only 28 years old. With that money he was able to invest in his second company named X.com, which later changed its name into PayPal. PayPal was at the time, and also today, one of the leading moneys transferring systems and because of that eBay bought the company in 2002 which now earned Elon 165 million dollars. Also, in 2002 he started his two biggest companies, SpaceX and Tesla. Tesla makes electric cars and SpaceX focuses on space and most relevant now, going to Mars. </p>

<p class = "about">What I believe makes him such a great role model is many reasons and to begin with it is pretty obvious that he is really hard working considering how far he has come and also according to an article by quartz he works on average 12 hours a day and still manages to have time for his children and dating which is pretty insane compared to the average person. But he also explains that a good sleeping schedule is crucial. And onto my second point, his humor, somehow in his spear time he gets to spend a just enough time to let his humor shine on twitter with the help of memes. And I interpret that as though he hasn’t fully lost his personality, as you may would expect with an entrepreneur. And onto what he has done for the world, where should I start, first of all, his company has made very successful electric car and promotes solar energy which is better for the environment and this is only one of his companies, at spacex he has done loads of work on making moving to mars even possible.
In conclusion he has so far done immense work for the future of this world and I don’t believe that he will stop soon either.  </p>
