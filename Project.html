    <h2 class = "abouttitle"> Project SpaceX </h2>
    <p class = "about" > SpaceX Mars program is a development program initiated by Elon Musk and SpaceX in order to facilitate the eventual colonization of Mars. The program includes fully reusable launch vehicles, human-rated spacecraft, on-orbit propellant tankers, rapid-turnaround launch/landing mounts, and local production of rocket fuel on Mars via in situ resource utilization (ISRU). SpaceX's aspirational goal has been to land the first humans on Mars by 2024,[1][2] but in October 2020 Elon Musk named 2024 as goal for an uncrewed mission, with a crewed mission to follow later.</p>

    <p class = "about"> A key element of the program is planned to be the SpaceX Starship, a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch vehicle under development since 2018. To achieve a large payload, the spacecraft would first enter Earth orbit, where it is expected to be refueled before it departs to Mars. After landing on Mars, the spacecraft would be loaded with locally-produced propellants to return to Earth. The expected payload for the Starship launch vehicle is to inject between 100–150 tonnes (220,000–330,000 lb) to Mars. </p>

    <p class = "about"> SpaceX intends to concentrate its resources on the transportation part of the Mars colonization project, including the design of a propellant plant based on the Sabatier process that will be deployed on Mars to synthesize methane and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants from the local supply of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-accessible water ice.[5] However, Musk has advocated since 2016 a larger set of long-term Mars settlement objectives, going far beyond what SpaceX projects to build; any successful colonization would ultimately involve many more economic actors—whether individuals, companies, or governments—to facilitate the growth of the human presence on Mars over many decades. </p>

    <h2 class = "abouttitle"> Neuralink </h2>
    <p class = "about" > The main aim of the project is to provide a direct connection between a brain and a computer to overcome the power of artificial intelligence (AI), using a "sewing machine-like" device to stitch threads to an implanted brain chip. Musk recently said that Neuralink's brain chip technology would allow people to stream music into their brains effortlessly.</p>

    <p class = "about"> He has also confirmed that the chip would be able to control hormone levels, which would have the potential to help with anxiety relief, among other things. </p>

    <p class = "about"> Neuralink’s device is a tiny computer chip, meant to be stitched by a “sewing-machine-like” robot into the brain on a network of superfine electrode-studded wires. It is supposed to pick up on signals in the brain and then translate them into motor controls. Many in the field imagine using these neural interfaces to control things like a prosthetic limb, or perhaps to interact with our gadgets. Musk, in typical Muskian fashion, has some bolder ideas. He has described Neuralink's project, overall, as helping to “achieve symbiosis with artificial intelligence.”</p>

    <h2 class = "abouttitle"> Tunnelling </h2>
    <p class = "about" >Chicago is one of several cities where Musk has spoken about using tunnel-boring technology developed by his Boring Co. for transportation projects. Among the furthest along is one that would scoot commuters underground on electric sleds called skates to the Los Angeles International Airport. Weeks after tweeting last year that snarling traffic was "driving me nuts," Musk said work on a tunnel was about to start. </p>

    <p class = "about">Last month, he said a portion of a tunnel was almost finished under an LA suburb and would soon be ready for testing. Among the challenges for any such project is to secure the necessary approval from state and municipal governments. Last year, a suburban city council approved an approximately 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) test tunnel from Musk's SpaceX rocket plant to a point east of LAX. </p>

  <div>
    <h2 class = "abouttitle"> Hyperloop </h2>
    <p class = "about" >Musk also wants to overhaul the entire US transportation system. He envisions an ultra-high-speed hyperloop system that involves nearly airless tubes that speed special capsules over long distances at up to 750 mph (1,200 kmph), using magnetism and solar power. It would carry both people and cargo. </p>

    <p class = "about">It's an idea many states are taking seriously. Several have said they are conducting feasibility studies, including Colorado, Texas and Missouri. Missouri was looking at whether such a system could be installed to move people between St. Louis and Kansas City in a half-hour's time. </p>
